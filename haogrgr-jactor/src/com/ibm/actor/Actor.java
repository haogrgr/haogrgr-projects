/**
 * An Actor is a (repeatedly) dispatchable unit of execution. Actors accept
 * messages and perform the operation (subject) they request. In response to
 * messages actors can perform business logic and/or send messages to other
 * actors (including themselves).
 * 
 * Actors can be grouped into categories. This allows senders to direct messages
 * to a category and have them processed by an arbitrary actor supporting that
 * category. Often some load balancing scheme is used to distribute messages
 * between actors if multiple actors belong to a category.
 * 
 * Since an actor consumes a thread while processing a message and threads are a
 * constrained resource, the actor should keep message processing as brief as
 * possible. If possible, long running operations should be broken down into a
 * sequence of messages.
 * 
 * Actors should not take much time to process a message - in particular they
 * should not block on long running actions, such as waiting for human input and
 * sometime I/O; if they must do this, some form of polling (repeated message
 * sends checking for completion, perhaps after a time delay) should be used to
 * implement a wait.
 * 
 * Messages have subjects and optional data. Subjects (AKA commands) determine
 * what the message is requesting and the data (often an array, list or map) are
 * any parameters to the subject.
 * 
 * The run() method is called once when the actor registers with a manager. The
 * loop() message is called whenever a message is received; actors can provide
 * implementations to allow filtering of messages before reception.
